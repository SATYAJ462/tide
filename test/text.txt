# Tide : Cleaner than Vim :P

I have implemented a text editor in Go..... But apparently Gtk+ hates the Go GC.
So decided to re write the whole project in C++ but using FLTK (Cross platform).
I think I have extensively documented the code. Unpack the attachment. cd into it.

**For building the editor**

```shell
make -j8
make run
```

**For documentation run this**

```shell
make doc
```

**For cleaning the source directory.**
*Note* : This also cleans the doc directory.

```shell
make clean
```

All the docs will be stored in the docs directory. Every class (.cpp,.hpp) have been mentioned in the docs.
Currently the editor doesn't do much than moving around, typing, selection, line number, line highlight. etc.,
(only keyboard sorry because the text editing component is wholly written from scratch in Cairo Vector Drawing.)
Soon this will evolve into a normal notepad with all necessary utils (~~Save~~, ~~Copy~~, ~~Paste~~, Find&Replace).
I have already tested a lua embeding (Why Lua ? : lightweight) for this with which plugins can be written.
Any thoughts and help is welcome. Currently It only consumes only 2 Megs of RAM.
